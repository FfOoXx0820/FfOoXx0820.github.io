And yes, I've been facing difficult challenges to adapt myself to a new environment, such as a new place to live, a new job, a new language, a new culture. But I believe it will eventually get better.</a>

        <br><a>Dear the Best Father in the World,</a>
        <br><br><a> Hi, I'm your lovely son, Andrew! Can you believe it? I'm 12 years old already! Thank you for raising me until now, and I know it must've been reaaally hard. I always feel really sorry for every rude things that I did to you, and thank you again. You are the best father in the world, and as far as I know, you are also the smartest father in the world! I didn't express this, but I always think you are really great and genius. You are intelligent, kind-heart, strong, and patient. What can I say more! You are literally perfect! Actually, there is one thing I want you to do. I just want you to listen carefully to others. I often feel sad when you don't answer me even if you are beside me. I feel like you are ignoring me! I know you wouldn't, so please answer right after you hear me! I always have been respecting you, my role model will be you forever. By the way, for Brawl Stars, when did you reach 15,000+ trophies! I always said you are bad at Brawl Stars, but actually, you are really good. I'm going to finish the letter right now, because it's almost 4. Bye! I love you!
        </a>
        <br><br><a>From, your Only Lovely Son.</a>
